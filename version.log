---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.4.0		Core pipeline based on Quistad et al (2020) using blastn for read comparison and megahit for assembly. It works... but it's slow and delivers poor contigs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.5.0		Improved read comparison by using BWA index with concatenated reads (from V+A) as a reference genome. This speeds up the analysis ~30 fold, but I have yet
		to run the benchmarks. So far the tests seems at least as good as 0.4.0 though.
0.5.1		Large subject libraries could run out of memory. I fixed that by chopping up the concatenated reference genome into pieces of 5,000,000 lines (=! reads) each.
0.5.2		In parallel with the Galaxy tool, I've made sure you can use multiple subject and query files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.0       Full version of the pipeline that applies all steps described in publication. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.0       Full support for parallel processing using the GNU parallel module
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.0       Added support for single-end reads
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.1	    Included a new type of output in the reference samples called "source_contigs", which are the fully-assembled contigs which are (part of) a mobile element
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.2	    Small changes that enables users to skip certain samples from being considered for xenoseq_find, while still being used in xenoseq_trace. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.3	    Added a function to leave the reference column empty so you can skip looking for contigs in some samples, while still tracing the identified contigs in those samples for abundance estimates 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.4	    Streamlined some of the logs and fixed a minor issue with version 1.2.3.
